<!--
I would like to have it with the talks like we have it with the posts.
That I have a folder _talks and a layout talk, and then just add
a few variables in the YAML front matter and then an automatically
generated list of the talks in this page.

But for now we do everything within this file with custom
styles and html-code.

    When I started learning C++, I have been told many times that it is a difficult to learn programming language.
For several reasons. One reason was, that it does not have a garbage collector or other kind of built-in resource management.
During my increasing experience with C++ I was pleased to recognize that quite the opposite is the case.
C++ has all the tools at hand to write resource safe code.
