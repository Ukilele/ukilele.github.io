My name is Kilian Henneberger. I work as a software developer in Germany.
I created this blog to share my ideas and knowledge about software development
mostly with focus on C++. I enjoy talking, teaching and especially learning about C++.
Occasionally you can find me hanging out on [Slack](cpplang.slack.com).
